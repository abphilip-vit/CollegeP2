# College: Line follower Robot using uC 8051

We designed an autonomous robot that follows a line dark traced on a light-colored surface, with the help of IR Sensors and the 8051 Microcontroller. The robot should detect this traced path and follow it without deviating. The objective of this project is to learn how the Microcontroller 8051 works when interfaced with IR sensors and be able to code the Microcontroller 8051 using Assembly Level Language.

The line follower robot is an autonomous robotic vehicle that follows a line traced on a background of large contrast, a black line on a white area for example. The robot detects this traced path and follows it without straying. It is a robot that follows a path or trajectory and decides its course of action when it interacts with an obstacle. Usually, the line follower robot works on a closed-loop feedback algorithm where the feedback from the line sensor is used by the controller for correcting the path of the robot. 

LED/LDR, LED/Photodiode, or LED/Phototransistor pairs are the sensors usually used and the controller is an 8051 microcontroller that executes the desired feedback algorithm. The wheels of the robot are controlled by gear motors. The Line follower we designed follows a black line by sensing the line we set and runs over it. One prominent use of a  line following robot is to transport materials from one place to another place in industries. This robot's movement completely depends on the track.
